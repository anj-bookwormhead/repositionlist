Repositioning list

<h4>Problem:</a>
Learnworlds platform doesn't allow you to create two separate categories.

<h4>Solution:</a>
Since the main concern is having two categories in the front-end. I separate the list of categories by repositioning the other <li> to a new Added HTML I created called Format. I also rename the category to Section.
